        A passion of mine is woodland animals and in particular non-profits that either rehabilitate and/or rescue same.  I want to introduce you to some <b>amazing</b> organizations that I have visited over the years.

                    <h2>Endangered Wolf Center</h2>
                </header>
                <p>The Endangered Wolf Center is located in Eureka, MO and has been around for over 40 years.  It's mission is to preserve and protect Mexican wolves, red wolves and other wild canid species, with purpose and passion, through carefully managed breeding, reintroduction and inspiring education programs. It has helped recover the Mexican gray wolf population from 9 wolves to 235 in managed care and over 75 in the wild! I have visited the Center many times for tours and for their annual event WolfFest.  On the tours you get to see several different types of wild candids and learn all about each candid at the center. Some of the wild candids at the Center are: Mexican Wolves, Red Wolves, Maned Wolves, Swift Foxes and African Painted Dogs.</p>

                <p>During WolfFest, not only can you walk around and check out the candid wolves but there are also other fun activities for the whole family going on. I've been very lucky to have a lemur hold my finger one year! There are other events that they host throughout the year, however, currently are just allowing specific tours at the moment due to COVID. If you have never been to the Endangered Wolf Center, I highly recommend scheduling a tour and learning about all the amazing work they do!</p>

                    <h2>Wildlife Rescue Center</h2>
                </header>
                <p>The Wildlife Rescue Center is located in Ballwin, MO.  It's mission is to rehabilitate sick, injured, and orphaned native wildlife and release healthy animals to their natural habitats. Through educational outreach the Center provides environmental awareness, promotes a harmonious relationship with native wildlife, and encourages the community to protect our delicate ecosystems. I went to one of their educational events and was able to learn what to do if I come upon a wild animal that looks injured or ill. I was also taken on a tour of the Center and shown many of the baby animals that were being nursed to health for release. The Center tries to rehabilitate and release as many of the animals as they can back into their natural habitats. If the animal cannot be released, they will find a rescue that will take care of the animal.</p>

                    <h2>SaveAFox Rescue</h2>
                </header>
                <p>SaveAFox Rescue is located in Minnesota. It's mission is to rescue and provide forever homes for captive-born, non-releasable wildlife. Many of the foxes at the Rescue are from fur farms. The foxes are given to the Rescue because they are sick, injured, or rejected, and therefore a liability or of no value to a fur farmer. There are other animals at the Rescue including a coyote, minks and cats to name just a few.</p>
                <p> Foxes are my favorite animals. Their beauty has always captured my heart. One of the happiest days of my life was when I found out that I could tour SaveAFox and meet the rescued foxes.</p>
